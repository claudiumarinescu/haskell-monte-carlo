# haskell-monte-carlo
Monte Carlo Tree Search (Haskell), used in  Tic Tac Toe.

Implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. This was a homework, so files like Test.hs, TestPP.hs and GameState.hs are not written by me (they were given as a local checker). I developed the code in MCTS.hs and TicTacToe.hs source files.

For testing the code, just type the following in a terminal:
  > stack runhaskell MCTSTest
  
For running only a certain test, after loading MCTSTest.hs with GHCI, type:
  > runTestPP <numeTest>
